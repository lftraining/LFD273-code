    "In this lab, we'll keep using the [100,000 UK Used Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes) from Kaggle. It contains scraped data of used car listings split into CSV files according to the manufacturer: Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes, Skoda, Toyota, Vauxhall, and VW. It also contains a few extra files of particular models (`cclass.csv`, `focus.csv`, `unclean_cclass.csv`, and `unclean_focus.csv`) that we won't be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file has nine columns with the car's attributes: model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, fuel consumption (mpg), and engine size. Transmission, fuel type, and year are discrete/categorical attributes, the others are continous. Our goal here is to predict the car's price based on its other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by building a datapipe that reads all the information from the CSV files, and then we'll use this datapipe as a drop-in replacement for the dataset we typically use with data loaders. The use of datapipes in its functional form, will illustrate some of the challenges when dealing with real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download the dataset, you'll need to create a Kaggle account. In the following sections, we're assuming the dataset was downloaded and unzipped to a local folder named `car_prices`. Alternatively, you can download it from the following link:\n",
